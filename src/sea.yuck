Usage: sea PROFILE < QUOTES

Deseasonalise QUOTES using a seasonality PROFILE.

  -R, --reverse         Consider QUOTES deseasonalised, produce original
                        time series again.
  -m, --modulus=T       Assume a season T (in seconds).
  -w, --width=W         Window width in seconds.
  -M, --mode=M          Use mode M, one of sprd (for deviation in spreads),
                        adev (for absolute deviations) and velo (for
                        deviations in velocity).
